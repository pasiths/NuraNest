People who consistently sleep less than the recommended hours are more likely to experience issues with weight management, insulin resistance, and increased appetite, especially for high-calorie, sugary foods.Furthermore, prioritizing sleep is crucial not just for physical health but also for maintaining optimal mental performance, \n"
              "emotional resilience, and overall well-being. A consistent, restful sleep pattern allows the brain to consolidate memories, process emotions, and rejuvenate, leading to improved focus, better learning outcomes, and a more positive outlook on life. Embracing good sleep hygieneâ€”such as sticking to a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and limiting exposure to screens before bedcan help individuals enjoy the full benefits of restorative sleep, ultimately contributing to a happier, healthier, and more productive life." ,
